The-Loremaster
==============

[ What is the "Loremaster"?]
The 'Loremaster' achievement is one of the most time intense achievement whitch you can get in the World of Warcraft.
For this Title you have to do ~6000 Quest in ALL Areas (Classic, Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria)


[ What makes this Profiel? ]
This profile helps you to get this title, and makes nearly all of the needed Quest's.
We're currently on the development of this Profiels, but we hope that we can release the single parts fast one after another.

This Profile is not Only written by me, else it uses some parts of other existing Profiles.

Before you hate me
If we release a new part, we would tell you when we used parts of another profile. And thank the author of this

If you see the bot stopped in the middle of nowhere and doing nothing, AND there are NO errors in the log/navigation log, please DON'T stop it and try to do things manually!!


[How can I Support?]
The best way to help me completing this is to give some feedback, quest parts or anything else to Profiles and tell me where you found problems.
A small tanks will help to motivate me ;)

[ Settings ]
LearnFlightpaths: On
Loot Mobs: On
Train New Skills: Off
UseFlightpaths: Off (the flights are coded into the profile)
Mail Recipient - A great idea to enable this, since you'll get loads of crap, that it won't sell.
Kill between Hotspots: Off (If you want to Level turn it On)


Normally you don't have to do any changes on your settings This is done by the Profiles


[ Things you need to know before running ]
Because this is my first Questing-Profile, i couldn't begin to rewrite all quest how i can get from another

Although I myself come from Germany, I use the english WoW client.
Should you try to use it with another client, I don't know if it works! But maybe you can tell me

This Profile will be hostet on Github. If you don't know how you can download it, write me or use the Github Help.
